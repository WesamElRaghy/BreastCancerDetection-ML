# Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates a simple machine learning model for breast cancer classification using the `sklearn` library. The notebook focuses on using the Breast Cancer dataset provided by `sklearn` to train a logistic regression model, predict cancer types (malignant or benign), and evaluate the model's performance.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`.
- Logistic Regression model for classification.
- Model evaluation with accuracy score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`

To install the required libraries, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
